## 🎨 Inspiration & Acknowledgment

The **CSS styling** for this project is based on the [vCard Personal Portfolio](https://github.com/codewithsadee/vcard-personal-portfolio) by **codewithsadee**.
Since the styles were already well-structured, I chose to keep them in a single `App.css` file instead of breaking them down into individual component styles.

I **transformed the project** by converting all **Vanilla JavaScript logic into React components**, optimizing performance, and implementing React best practices such as:  
✅ State management with `useState` and `useEffect`  
✅ Component-based structure for better reusability  
✅ Improved modularity and scalability

The original project is licensed under the **MIT License**, and the license file is included in this repository.
